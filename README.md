#### Setting Up Magento 2 on Multi-container Architecture Using Docker-Compose tool

This repository corresponds to architecture setup as mentioned in blog https://cloudkul.com/blog/magento-2-docker-compose/.


###### Docker-Compose Tool

As mentioned in Docker docs, Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application’s services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 

With the help of docker-compose we can define containers to be built, their configuration, links, volumes, ports etc in a single file and it gets launched by a single command. We can add multiple servers and services just by adding them to docker-compose configuration file. This configuration file is in YAML format.

Getting started with docker-compose is a few steps process:

> Create a Dockerfile defining the application environment. We can create separate Dockerfile for our different services. As Dockerfile are lightweight, so our application can be replicated anywhere.

> Create a docker-compose.yml file defining services that needed for application run. We can define volumes to be mapped, ports to be exposed, links to be created, arguments to be passed etc in our docker-compose.yml file.

> Run ‘docker-compose build’ to create Docker image. After creating Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and placing our volumes at right places, we can create our image.

> Run ‘docker-compose up -d’ to run the docker containers. After image build up, we can run all of our containers as mentioned in configuration files by this single command.
